# Python-Projects



Projects I have been building with Python

- Phonebook
- File Transfer Program
- Django 


Phonebook

A script with a database that allows you to save delete and modify user info


File Transfer Program

A script combined with tkinter that allows you to select a source folder and a destination path, and gives you the functionality to copy any files that were modified within the last 24 hours.

Django 

Using Django Framework, created a project called "DjangoUniversity" in a virtual environment where we created models and made migrations.
